goal of the branch:
this is an attempt to create zoned port mappings and unify the deployment of compose files in some deternimistic way


tasks
   - compose files will need to have updated inbound port variable
   - common will need the port maps and be able to create a random port
   - common will need Variable base on job name that will map to the compose files
   - define flow for pipeline
   - define what goes in the docker compose files as varibles and what is deternimistic
   - check that the selected ports are clear before deploying, if not incriment by 1 until safe
   - do the safety check of ports before running docker compose
   -    

problem 
need to save data sometimes and want to keep it sane
currently I store in docker compose as 

what if
I go more generic in the compose files so common features like rpc port or data can be mapped easier. 

The vault will save the zone for rpc, p2p, metrics, services, etc in common as a random zone defined as xxx

we will create the environmental COMPOSE_<port|data|etc> that will be left side port in compose and other variables common across compose files 

The jobName will map to the compose folder in vault COMMON this is stored as COMPOSE_FILE

work flow steps

get the vault common and 
problem
how will i get the compose file specific variables

where are they stored because it wouldnt be in common
they are stored in the JOBNAME vault
can I check jobname vault and just pull everything
