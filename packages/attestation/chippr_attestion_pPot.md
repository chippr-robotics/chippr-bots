I, Cody Burns, have completed my part in the Perpetual Powers of Tau MPC. I was assisted in this ceremony by my beautiful wife Jennifer whose job it was to 
monitor the server during the cermony to make sure it wasn't interfered with. After receiving the challenge file, the hash was verified using 
b2sum on an ubuntu server as well as with the PoT program. The program then ran for several hours after which the response file ( hash follows ) was uploaded via sftp. 
An image of the hash from the ceremony was uploded to twitter https://twitter.com/chipprbots/status/1207049756305809408?s=20
